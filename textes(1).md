Every day we make 100 cupcakes of a special flavor not on the menu. Order it by name & it's free! You have to act fast though, when all 100 are gone the deal is done for the day. (Limit 1 per customer.) 
 P.S. We post the flavor name on Twitter about 30 minutes before the website, so follow us to get a head start.
